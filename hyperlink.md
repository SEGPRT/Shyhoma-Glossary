# What is the hyperlink?

Think of it as the internet, this is how you connect to other worlds, it is our form of connection from our discord client to their sms/messaging systems.

It is a mess of connections and nodes, it holds data while also being unfathomable in how it works, we have a map of the basic place as of MB \[BE CAREFUL THIS PART IS HIGHLY LIKELY TO CHNAGE\]
![This is a map of the Hyperlink, be careful as this may be outdated as of Above](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/999325042158612601/1000064633828282418/IMG_20220722_183937.jpg?ex=6569fe45&is=65578945&hm=57dd3426c567c6745f0920bd32a8ed44fb9764a5df32567977dabbfb758ec1dd&=&width=502&height=671)

Additionally, we are unawear about the glitchlands and other servers, other than the fact that hoplerdur has been known to transfer this hyperlink.

Also, we can travel the Hyperlink using the Dat.Bas server<!>LINK NOT ATTATCHED DUE TO LIKELY INABILITY TO TRAVEL NEW HYPERLINK? UNKNOWN<!<.<!>
