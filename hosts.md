# What are the Hosts

Hosts kind of, run the game on Shyhoma, they are what makes things tick, what makes it interesting and a key point in many conflicts of ours, we have a history of going against Host's personal interests.

It appears all hosts have a second personality or, shadow as you may put it, that persists over death, for example, the drought I, Marko know, is not the same as many others know, as that is Drown, drought in my experience was more antagonistic In Deadline, however Drown was much more useful in further args, helping us by giving us information to the future.

Hosts are part of and entity class called Lochs, I'd make a doc on this, however I don't have much information on this. Just know that the order of entities is
Lochs-> Us -> Ownets (these are all we know) Ownets need a master, and we count as gods according to Intrus.

## Selior 
*The first host of the first Shyhoma ARG*

Unfortunately a lot of this information on him is lost to time, as none of the original players are still active to this day.

All hosts represent aspects, Selior represents  mystery, curiosity, and survival. This is the only information I truely have on Selior.

## Drought/Drown 
The host of the second Shyhoma ARG "Shyhoma Deadline"

Drought was a pretty antagonistic voice, as far as notes go he helped us once I belive, in where he stopped a system from shutting down because it had like 100 security questions, he pretended to be the hyperlink, I suggest that maybe he had Galvin/Sandoralic's job prior to aplising, 

We don't really know much about Drown, we know Drown offers of information in a cryptic way, by hiding it behind several layers of symbolism. We belive Drown wishes for us to finish our goal, to kill DaHasu.

All hosts represent aspects, Drought/drown represents Strategy, Future, Unfairness

## Galvin/Sandoralic 
*The host of the 3rd shyhoma ARG "Shyhoma Mb"*

Galvin, is very controlling, he did not want us to go against him, there was once a time where he put us in a completely seperate universe of his own creation so we couldnt interact with the true world anymore, but then, we went against him and it ended in his aplision. Most of our history is unimportant, if required a seperate glossary entry will be created.

Galvin's shadow/second personality, Sandoralic, is likely the one we know the most closley, we know that they actually have a compleatly seperate life than the host. Sandoralic was someone that we know keeps the Hyperlink in check, they moniter any message that goes through and is the Entity we have to speak to if something fucks up in the Hyperlink, we have a positive relationship with sandoralic.

All hosts represent aspects, Galvin represents help, protection, and controll.

...

## Intrus
*4th host of the Shyhoma ARG, "-search-"*

Now where do we start with Intrus, Intrus vehimently protects what he belives is the balance. Even when in our view it seems like we are losing Intrus still belives in the fact that the balance is still in tact. We actually started off with amicable relations with Intrus, however as previous trends, we ended up going against Intrus in the end of it all.

We presume that Intrus has a second personality, however we are not privy to this.

All hosts represent aspects, Intrus represents evil, loss, and balance.

...

## Curenco/Divider 
*5th host of the shyhoma ARG, "Shyhoma W.H.O" AKA "Shyhoma Dispatch and Mechanics"*

Curenco is of the minority that we generally had a positive relationship with. He had an affinity for slang, and he also ran a shop where we would trade things. EX: 10 Slang words for a weapon to one of the characters.

The Divider is the second personality of Curenco, in the past he has "divided" images, finding less corruped verisions of said images.

All host represent aspects, curenco represents greed, honesty, and knowledge.


## Truthera 
*The 6th and current cost of the Shyhoma arg "Above"*

Truthera generally has been pretty nice to us, she has helped us in the previous arg Shyhoma W.H.O. and she also has been the few Hosts that we actually visibally see affect the world instead of behind the scenes. She has also given us several peices of valuable information as well.

We currently don't know Truthera's second personality, this may change :\)

All hosts represent aspects, Truthera represents love, good, and closure.
